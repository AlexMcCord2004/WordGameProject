The WordSearchGameImpl class is a Java implementation of a word search game that uses a lexicon of valid words and a square game board. It allows loading words from a file into a HashSet for fast lookup and includes functionality to set up the board, validate words and prefixes, find valid words using depth-first search (DFS), and calculate scores based on word lengths. The board is represented as a one-dimensional array, and methods like isSquare ensure its dimensions are valid. The class includes robust error handling, such as defaulting to a predefined lexicon if the specified file is unavailable. It also provides methods to retrieve the board's layout, validate word paths, and score found words, making it a complete and efficient solution for a word search game.
